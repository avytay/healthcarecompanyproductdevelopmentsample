# Healthcare Analytics Company Solutions - Product Development
Hello! I made a Product Development and Management Flow Page to conduct market research on and assess payer product successes.

## Background
Aledade's mission is to help PCPs organize into accountable care organizations (ACOs) to provide them with the benefit of data analytics, technology, regulatory expertise, strong payer relationships and local, hands-on guidance to reduce healthcare costs. Aledade works with a variety of payer programs including Medicare Advantage, Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) commercial payers, Medicaid, and Group/ Commercial.

After its most recent round of funding, Aledade is seeking to grow its partnerships through its products, including:
* Aledade App: A technology platform that enables healthcare providers to efficiently manage patient populations, track performance metrics, and access actionable insights.
* Practice Transformation: Aledade works with primary care practices to support their transition to value-based care models. They provide guidance and tools to enhance care coordination, improve patient outcomes, and reduce healthcare costs.
* Data Analytics: Aledade leverages advanced analytics to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for performance improvement. They use data-driven insights to help providers make informed decisions and optimize their patient care strategies.
* Quality Improvement: Aledade assists practices in achieving and maintaining high-quality care standards. They offer guidance on quality measures, performance tracking, and implementation of evidence-based protocols.
* Network Development: Aledade builds and manages networks of independent primary care practices that collaborate to improve patient care and participate in value-based contracts with payers and health systems.
* Care Management: Aledade supports care coordination efforts by providing tools and resources to enhance communication and collaboration among healthcare providers. They help practices identify and manage high-risk patients and connect them to appropriate resources.
* Regulatory Compliance: Aledade stays updated with evolving healthcare regulations and helps practices navigate the complex landscape. They offer guidance on compliance requirements, coding, and documentation to ensure adherence to regulatory standards.

I created an assessment/development sample plan for one of these payer products, the Aledade App.

Aledade App Features:
* Electronic Health Records
* Wellness Worklists
* ED Utilization
* Payer Claims
* Population Health Tools
* Daily Huddles
* Practice-Generated Insights

#### General Product Troubleshooting Timeline
* Step 1: [Product Vision or Problem Validation]
The most effective products start with a comprehensive market-based, insight-driven strategy. Identify the right problems to solve through market research, target user definition, and market sizing. Create a compelling vision and strategy that will set up the team to solve those problems. 
* Step 2: [Design Sprint]  
Take an idea through concept, design, and user validation phases, and create a spec to handoff to the engineering team for development. Use design-thinking methodologies to explore various ideas, and then converge on a single idea. Map out the full concept through creation of a prototype that can be used to validate that youâ€™re solving a problem for real users.
* Step 3: [Product Development] 
Critical soft skills needed to manage the development and execution phase of the product. Collaborate with cross-functional teams and stakeholders to guide them through planning and execution. Manage stakeholder expectations and handle risks that arise, reprioritizing feature and sprint priorities to tackle competing requests.
* Step 4: [Go-to-Market] 
Create a plan, identify the launch risks, and figure out how to minimize their impact on the launch. Prepare a product requirements document to define to the development and testing teams what capabilities must be included in a product release. Collaborate with a variety of teams including Marketing, Sales, Customer Support, and more to prepare them to interface with customers as the product is launched. Execute the launch and use feedback from customers to determine the next steps for the product.  
* Step 5: [Product Management]


Step 1 is demonstrated as a sample...

## Problem Validation

### What are the most successful and utilized features of the Aledade App?

#### Validation Goals and Outcomes
* Understand the user problem we are trying to solve.
* Identify business goals and key metrics to determine success.
* Generate hypotheses and research/experiment/user-test.
* Define potential future iterations.
* Minimize risks to value, usability, feasibility, and business viability with qualitative and quantitative analysis.

#### General Flaws That Users May Experience With Healthcare Software Applications
* Technical Issues: Software applications can encounter technical glitches, such as slow performance, crashes, or compatibility issues with specific devices or operating systems. These issues can affect user experience and productivity.
* User Interface/User Experience: The app's user interface and user experience design might not be intuitive or user-friendly for all users. Complicated navigation, unclear instructions, or poor organization of information can make it challenging for users to effectively utilize the app.
* Data Accuracy and Integration: Healthcare apps often rely on data integration from multiple sources. Inaccurate or outdated data can impact the effectiveness of the app and compromise patient care. Challenges related to data quality, interoperability, and integration with electronic health record (EHR) systems can be potential issues.
* Limited Functionality: Depending on the specific features and capabilities of the Aledade app, users may find that certain functionalities they desire are missing or not fully developed. Lack of integration with other relevant tools or limited customization options may also be perceived as flaws.

### Internal Product Success Workflow Using SQL

In order to determine to determine the most utilized app feature based on user activity:

Step 1: Connect to the database
Establish a connection to the app's database using the appropriate credentials and connection parameters.

Step 2: Identify the relevant tables
Identify the tables in the database that contain the necessary data to track user activity related to each app feature. These tables may vary depending on the specific database schema and the app's implementation.

Step 3: Define the metrics
In this case, we want to measure the utilization of each app feature. We can define the following metric:
* Utilization: The number of times each app feature has been accessed or used by users.

Step 4: Run SQL queries
Write SQL queries to extract and aggregate the necessary data from the relevant tables. The queries should count the number of times each app feature has been utilized by users. 

Example Code:

* SELECT 'Electronic Health Records' AS AppFeature, COUNT(*) AS Utilization
* FROM user_activity
* WHERE app_feature = 'Electronic Health Records'
* UNION ALL
* SELECT 'Wellness Worklists' AS AppFeature, COUNT(*) AS Utilization
* FROM user_activity
* WHERE app_feature = 'Wellness Worklists'
* UNION ALL
* SELECT 'ED Utilization' AS AppFeature, COUNT(*) AS Utilization
* FROM user_activity
* WHERE app_feature = 'ED Utilization'
* UNION ALL
* SELECT 'Payer Claims' AS AppFeature, COUNT(*) AS Utilization
* FROM user_activity
* WHERE app_feature = 'Payer Claims'
* UNION ALL
* SELECT 'Population Health Tools' AS AppFeature, COUNT(*) AS Utilization
* FROM user_activity
* WHERE app_feature = 'Population Health Tools'
* UNION ALL
* SELECT 'Daily Huddles' AS AppFeature, COUNT(*) AS Utilization
* FROM user_activity
* WHERE app_feature = 'Daily Huddles'
* UNION ALL
* SELECT 'Practice-Generated Insights' AS AppFeature, COUNT(*) AS Utilization
* FROM user_activity
* WHERE app_feature = 'Practice-Generated Insights';

Step 5: Execute the query
Execute the SQL query against the database to retrieve the utilization count for each app feature.
